 * Arming a probe a second time needs the struct handed back the way the kernel left it the
 * first time.
 *
 * register_kprobe() resolves .symbol_name only while .addr is NULL: kprobe_addr()
 * (kernel/kprobes.c) answers ERR_PTR(-EINVAL) as soon as both are set -
 *
 *     if ((symbol_name && addr) || (!symbol_name && !addr))
 *             goto invalid;
 *     ...
 * invalid:
 *     return ERR_PTR(-EINVAL);
 *
 * - and register_kprobe() stores the address it resolved BEFORE the checks that can still
 * fail it (`p->addr = addr;` sits above check_kprobe_rereg()/check_kprobe_address_safe()), so
 * the field is written even when the call returns an error.  unregister_kprobes() clears it
 * only for a probe that was never on a list:
 *
 *     for (i = 0; i < num; i++)
 *             if (__unregister_kprobe_top(kps[i]) < 0)
 *                     kps[i]->addr = NULL;    /* only on failure */
 *
 * which means a probe that DID arm keeps its address after it is removed.
 *
 * Put together: a struct kprobe that has armed once - or whose registration failed after the
 * symbol was resolved - can never be registered again.  Every later register_kprobe() on that
 * struct returns -EINVAL without touching the address, so the feature it carries stays off for
 * the rest of the module's life, and a failed retry looks exactly like a symbol that is not
 * probeable.
 *
 * Both sequences are ordinary here: every enable/disable control surface disarms and arms
 * again (the avc node, the sus_mount supercall), and every rule-management path retries a
 * registration that failed earlier (kstat's maps hook, open_redirect's forward and reverse
 * hooks, uname's set, sus_map's probes).  So both sides clear the field: the arm side before
 * it returns an error, the disarm side after unregistering.  sus_mount_fdinfo_arm()/disarm()
 * already did that by hand for its dynamically resolved addresses; these two helpers are the
 * same statement, so the next probe does not have to rediscover why it is needed.
 *
 * A kretprobe embeds its kprobe, hence the second helper.
