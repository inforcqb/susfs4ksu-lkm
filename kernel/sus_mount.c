 * sus_mount.c - hide KSU mounts from /proc/mounts and /proc/mountinfo.
 *
 * Upstream SUSFS skips a mount line when r->mnt_id >= DEFAULT_KSU_MNT_ID, and
 * (patch:1561-1585) installs those show functions only for NON-ksu domains
 * (!susfs_is_current_ksu_domain() in mounts_open()/mountinfo_open()/mountstats_open()),
 * so the su/ksu domain keeps seeing its own mounts (zygisk in post-fs-data and ksud
 * break otherwise).  The stock show functions are static but sit behind proc_ops function
 * pointers, so they are NOT LTO-inlined and stay kprobe-able (verified in kallsyms); the
 * LKM hooks all three with a kprobe pre_handler and returns early (regs->pc = x30) for a
 * KSU-range id, under the same domain gate.  struct mount / real_mount() come from the
 * private fs/mount.h (its includes are all public headers, so -I$(srctree)/fs is enough).
 *
 * The LKM hooks all three show functions with a kprobe pre_handler and returns
 * early (regs->pc = x30) when the mount id is in the KSU range - but only for
 * non-su/ksu processes, mirroring upstream's domain gate: the su domain must
 * keep seeing its own mounts or su tooling (zygisk in post-fs-data, ksud)
 * breaks.  struct mount / real_mount() come from the private fs/mount.h (its
 * includes are all public headers, so -I$(srctree)/fs is enough).
 *
 * HOW THE ID RANGE IS PRODUCED (this is the part that used to be missing):
 * upstream gets KSU mounts into that range by ADDING an allocator
 * (susfs_alloc_non_unshare_ksu_vfsmnt(), which calls
 * ida_alloc_min(&mnt_id_ida, DEFAULT_KSU_MNT_ID, GFP_KERNEL), patch:676-693) and
 * SWAPPING THE CALL SITES in vfs_create_mount()/clone_mnt() (patch:764, 800);
 * mnt_alloc_id() itself is never patched.  The LKM does not patch kernel text
 * at all, so its stock allocator (plain ida_alloc, smallest free id) keeps
 * handing out small ids - measured on device: 91..39693, so the old fixed 2e9
 * threshold could never match and the feature was 100% OFF.
 *
 * A mount is one of ours when mnt_devname contains "/data/adb/" (KSU/module bind mounts)
 * or the mount POINT - d_path() of {mnt, mnt_root}, the path show_mountinfo() prints - is
 * under /data/adb (catches meta-overlayfs, whose source is /dev/block/loopNN).  Marked ids
 * are never restored on disable, matching upstream, where an id is assigned once at mount
 * time and stays for the mount's lifetime.
 *
 * The new id is a REAL id taken from the kernel's own mnt_id_ida:
 *   ida_alloc_range(&mnt_id_ida, DEFAULT_KSU_MNT_ID, INT_MAX - 1, GFP_KERNEL)
 * NOT an invented number.  That is not a style choice.  mnt_free_id()
 * (fs/namespace.c:136-139) unconditionally calls ida_free(&mnt_id_ida,
 * mnt->mnt_id) when the mount finally goes away, so a hand-made id makes
 * lib/idr.c:523-525 fire WARN(1, "ida_free called for id=%d which is not
 * allocated.") on umount - and a WARN plus stack dump in dmesg is exactly the
 * kind of trace a root detector greps for, i.e. worse than the feature doing
 * nothing.  Upstream is under the same constraint and short-circuits the free
 * for its fake ids (patch:582-588); mnt_free_id() is static + LTO-inlined on
 * this kernel, so we cannot patch it - owning the id for real is the fix.
 *
 * Degradation: if mnt_id_ida / ida_alloc_range / ida_free cannot ALL be
 * resolved, nothing is marked at all.  min_mnt_id then stays false, the feature
 * does nothing, and every missing symbol is named in a pr_warn.  Falling back to
 * a self-made id is deliberately NOT an option (see the WARN above).
 *
 * A mount is recognised by either of:
 *   - mnt_devname contains "/data/adb/" (KSU/module bind mounts, whose source is
 *     the file under /data/adb/modules/...);
 *   - the mount POINT - d_path() of {mnt, mnt_root}, i.e. the same path
 *     show_mountinfo() prints - is under /data/adb (catches meta-overlayfs, whose
 *     source is a loop device: "/dev/block/loop48
 *     /data/adb/modules/meta-overlayfs/mnt ext4 rw,...").
 * Marked ids are never restored on disable, matching upstream, where an id is
 * assigned once at mount time and stays for the mount's lifetime.
 *
 * ---- the namespace that matters, and why identity is remembered as well
 *
 * KernelSU mounts module content into the ZYGOTE's mount namespace, because that
 * is the namespace every app is forked into.  The same filesystem is therefore a
 * different mount OBJECT there, with an id of its own - measured on this device:
 * /data/adb/modules/meta-overlayfs/mnt is id 2000000000 in the init namespace and
 * id 1111 in the zygote's.  Marking is what creates the big id, so it could only
 * cover the namespaces that existed when it ran; the id test alone then hid the
 * line in one view and left it in the app's own mount table - the one a checker
 * actually reads.
 *
 * The fix is identity, not a wider scan: sweeping every namespace from the task
 * list would mean walking another namespace's mount list, and only the ns_lock
 * half of that protocol is reachable from a module (namespace_sem is static in
 * fs/namespace.c) - a foreign namespace mounts and unmounts while we walk it,
 * which is exactly the class of thing that takes a device down.  Instead the
 * mount's IDENTITY is remembered by the scan that already runs safely in the
 * caller's namespace:
 *
 *   - superblock device + root dentry (both belong to the filesystem, so the same
 *     filesystem mounted in the zygote is matched), plus a path-shaped source
 *     string for equality;
 *   - the hide hooks accept identity as well as a KSU-range id, and hiding an
 *     identity-matched mount learns its id into the same id -> shown-id mapping, so
 *     fdinfo/statx keep naming a mount line the caller can still see.
 *
 * Known blind spots of the scan:
 *   - overlayfs mounts that KernelSU places on /system have d_path "/system"
 *     and mnt_devname "overlay", so they are NOT recognised; only intercepting
 *     vfs_create_mount()/clone_mnt() by su domain (upstream's group (1)) would
 *     catch those;
 *   - only the mount namespace of the process that enables the feature is
 *     scanned; a mount namespace cloned later (copy_mnt_ns()/unshare()) gets
 *     fresh small ids from the stock allocator (upstream handles that in
 *     clone_mnt() with CL_COPY_MNT_NS, patch:789-810).

 * The key is the one piece of state the kernel can hand to somebody else: mnt ids go back to

 * therefore carries the s_dev it was learned on and is dropped when (a) its superblock is torn
 * down (kprobe on generic_shutdown_super(), the earliest point where nothing can have taken the
 * id yet), (b) a mount that is NOT ours is seen carrying that id - proof of a recycle, so the
 * hide hook drops the entry right there (sus_mount_idmap_drop()), which is what keeps the table
 * fixed-size by reusing freed slots - or (c) it is refreshed by seeing one of OUR mounts again.
 * Left over is an id recycled while nobody reads a mount table at all: no reader then holds a

 * namespace carries whatever id the stock allocator gave it (measured: the
 * meta-overlayfs mount is 2000000000 in the init namespace and 1111 in the
 * zygote's), so the id test hid the line in one view and left it in the other - the
 * app's own mount table, the one a checker reads.
 *
 * So the scan remembers what survives a namespace boundary (the mount OBJECT does not, its
 * filesystem does): s_dev + root ino, exact and cheap, because the root dentry is shared by
 * every mount of a superblock and a second tmpfs has its own root inode.  The NUMBER is
 * stored, not the dentry pointer: a held pointer would need dget() - pinning dentry and inode
 * past the superblock's shutdown, measured: rmmod of that build dput()'d it and panicked in
 * shmem_evict_inode, "Oops: Fatal exception" - or be used unlocked after the mount is gone.
 * mnt_devname is compared only when it is a path (starts with '/'), so a recorded
 * "tmpfs"/"overlay" cannot hide every mount of that kind.
 *
 * Only mounts the scan ACCEPTS are recorded, so this never widens into "hide anything that
 * looks similar".  A record is valid only while its filesystem is mounted, and its keys are
 * reusable: measured, a tmpfs mounted/recorded/unmounted by this test left s_dev 0:304 and
 * root inode 1 behind and the very next tmpfs got both, i.e. a stale record hid an unrelated
 * filesystem - hence the kprobe on generic_shutdown_super() that drops every record whose

 * it, and namespace_sem was released inside copy_mnt_ns() (fs/namespace.c:3986).  The

 *   - ns_lock keeps us out of the kernel's own list readers and of every list

/* ---- insmod parameters must not touch the guard-protected side --------------------------------
 * module_param_cb()'s setter runs during load_module()'s parse_args(), i.e. BEFORE susfs_init() has
 * reached susfs_imports_guard() and before this layer is up.  sus_mount_keep_command() is not
 * import-free: committing the list takes spin_lock_irqsave(&mount_keep_lock) and the rescan walks the
 * mount namespace - and _raw_spin_lock_irqsave is one of the imports the guard's table covers
 * (imports_guard.c), so a loader that left it at zero jumped to address 0 before anything could refuse
 * the load.  The setter therefore validates the shape and caches the raw value, and
 * susfs_sus_mount_init() applies it through the same entry point once the guard has passed.
 * mount_keep_ready marks the point after which the setter applies live, and sus_mount_keep_param_lock
 * keeps the two orders from interleaving (the commit replaces the list, so a write landing between
 * "ready = true" and the cached apply must not be clobbered by the older value).  (That guard table is
 * not the whole import set: ordinary exports such as strscpy/kvmalloc are the loader's and the
 * build-time System.map gate's business, so the validation below may use them.)
 *
 * One entry of that table is still reached from here on purpose: sus_mount_keep_param_lock is taken in
 * parse_args(), and mutex_lock/mutex_unlock are in that table as well - so a loader that left those two
 * at zero would jump to address 0 before susfs_init() could refuse the load.  It is not removable by a
 * local change: the mutex is what orders "cache the value" against "apply the cached value", and the
 * other mutual-exclusion primitives available here (_raw_spin_lock*, __rcu_read_*) are in that table
 * too.  Closing it needs a lock-free publication of the cached value (store, then re-check the ready
 * flag and apply live), which is a change of its own. */
